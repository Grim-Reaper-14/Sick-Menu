# Sick-Menu

Sick Menu targets **Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced** and exposes its gameplay API through the public `Reaper` namespace.

## Reaper native backend

Feature code stays small and typed:

```cpp
#include "Reaper.hpp"

const Reaper::Ped ped = Reaper::PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID();
Reaper::ENTITY::SET_ENTITY_INVINCIBLE(ped, true);
```

The preferred Enhanced path preloads native handlers once and then invokes them by generated `NativeIndex`:

```text
UI / Lua / Features
        |
        v
Reaper::PLAYER / ENTITY / ...
        |
        v
NativeInvoker::Invoke<NativeIndex>()
        |
        v
NativeHandlerTable[index]
        |
        v
Enhanced native handler
```

`NativeBootstrap` receives a host-provided native provider and warms the indexed handler table during startup. The menu does not perform a hash lookup for every normal typed native call. A raw hash resolver remains available for diagnostics and developer tooling.

```cpp
Reaper::Native::Handler ResolveNative(
    Reaper::NativeHash hash,
    Reaper::Enhanced::BuildId build)
{
    // Supply this from the allowed GTA V Enhanced host/runtime adapter.
    return nullptr;
}

bool StartBackend(Reaper::Enhanced::BuildId build)
{
    return Reaper::Enhanced::Game::InitializeIndexed(
        build,
        &ResolveNative
    );
}
```

The generated-native layer currently starts with a small verified set and is structured for a generator to expand `NativeIndex.hpp`, `NativeHashes.hpp`, metadata, and typed namespace wrappers together.

## Script globals

`Reaper::ScriptGlobal` provides `At()` traversal and typed `As<T>()` access while keeping address resolution behind a host callback:

```cpp
Reaper::Enhanced::Game::BindScriptGlobalResolver(&ResolveScriptGlobal);

auto value = Reaper::ScriptGlobal(123456)
    .At(5)
    .As<std::int64_t&>();
```

This keeps game-version-specific global resolution outside feature code.

## Backend components

- `src/game/enhanced/` - Enhanced build integration, indexed bootstrap, script-global facade, and lifecycle.
- `src/game/natives/` - call context, invoker, handler table, resolver, registry, diagnostics, and generated native IDs/hashes.
- `src/game/scheduler/` - gameplay job queue separated from UI/render callbacks.
- `src/game/services/` - higher-level gameplay services built on typed natives.
- `src/Reaper.hpp` - public API facade.

## Tests

```text
cmake -S . -B build -DSICK_NATIVE_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

The tests use mock native handlers/providers and do not require GTA to be running.
